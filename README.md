# Hamming-Encoder-Decoder

Hamming code is a set of error-correction codes that can be used to detect and correct the errors that can occur when the data is moved or stored from the sender to the receiver. 
It is technique developed by R.W. Hamming for error correction.

Designed and Synthesized a Hamming encoder and Decoder for error correction while transmitting bits. 

Simulated on Xilinx Vivado. Hardware tested on Digilent Basys 3 FPGA board.
